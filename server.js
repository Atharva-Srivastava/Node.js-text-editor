// I have set up a connection event, the function callback has a socket argument.
//The socket registers a message event, it has a handler function that broadcast the data event passed to it to all other sockets connected
//to the server when the message event is fired.

// As all users have a message event they are listening to, the message handler will be executed because the server emitted a message event,
//so all userâ€™s textarea will be set with the text passed over the socket connection.
